## Description

The SVG Logo Generator is a command-line application that allows users to create custom SVG logos based on their input. With this application, users can specify text content, text color, shape type, and shape color to generate a unique logo. The application supports up to three characters for the text input and accepts color keywords or hexadecimal values for both text and shape colors.

Upon running the application, users are prompted to enter the desired text, text color, shape type, and shape color. Once all the inputs are provided, the application generates an SVG file named `(NameOfShape).svg` in the `shapes` folder. The SVG file incorporates the specified text and shape, with the text rendered in Times New Roman font.

To view the generated logo, users can open the `(NameOfShape).svg` file in a web browser, which displays a 300x200 pixel image of the logo. Additionally, the application automatically opens the SVG file in Visual Studio Code for further editing and customization.

The SVG Logo Generator is implemented using Node.js and utilizes the `inquirer` and `open` packages for user input and file manipulation. It follows the principles of object-oriented programming with the Triangle, Circle, and Square classes representing the different shapes, and Jest tests are included to ensure the correctness of the shape classes' `render()` method.

Whether you need a simple logo for personal projects or want to experiment with different shapes and colors, the SVG Logo Generator provides a flexible and intuitive solution for creating visually appealing logos.
